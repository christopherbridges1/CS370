Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
On this project, I learned many valuable skills. I was given code that set up a training environment for a pirate treasure game. My goal was to create a function that trained the agent to find the treasure.

Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
AI has become a large presence in the modern digital landscape. Learning the fundamentals and how they function is a valuable skill.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientists study and create new technology and discover how it can be applied to improve the human experience.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
Identify a problem or a concern and develop a solution from the end user's perspective. Tech doesn't work if the people using it can't understand it.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
There are many ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization. Training an AI to be as unbiased as possible and testing it thoroughly before it reaches production. Ensuring I create code to the best of my abilities while maintaining a high level of security and maintain industry standards.
